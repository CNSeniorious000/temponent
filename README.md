# Temponent

> *Temponent* is for **temp**late + com**ponent**

I want to build a template framework in python that support component-based development like what front-end frameworks do.

## Future Features (or TODOs?)

- [ ] support spaces inside expression like `{{ a + b }}`
- [ ] implement `import` syntax
- [ ] support while loop and isolated variable declaration
- [ ] lazy compiling(assembling)
- [ ] directory based routing
- [ ] auto refresh when template file changes detected (only in dev mode and template is valid)
- [ ] caching maybe?
