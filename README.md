# Temponent

> *Temponent* is for **temp**late + com**ponent**

I want to build a template framework in python that support component-based development like what front-end frameworks do.

## Future Features (or TODOs?)

- [ ] support spaces inside expression like `{{ a + b }}`
- [x] implement `import` syntax
- [x] support [`slot` syntax](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-slot)
- [ ] components with parameters
- [ ] support something like [`named slot` syntax](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-slot-slot-name-name)
- [ ] support while loop and isolated variable declaration
- [ ] `else` and `elif` tag
- [x] lazy compiling(assembling)
- [ ] directory based routing
- [ ] auto refresh when template file changes detected (only in dev mode and template is valid)
- [ ] caching maybe?
